  ## Introducing OSINTBuddy

  <p>
      Welcome to the OSINTBuddy project where you can connect, combine,
      and get insight from unstructured and public data as results that
      can be explored step-by-step. An easy-to-use plugin system allows any
      Python developer to quickly integrate new data sources.

### What is <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://osintbuddy.com">osintbuddy.com</a>?


Not much, yet.


But here's the concept:


An almost incomprehensible amount of data is created every day. And each year, figures are growing at an ever-increasing rate. These data sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:

- Public government data
- Media *(newspapers, magazines, radio)*
- Internet *(blogs, discussion groups, citizen media, etc)*
- Professional and academic publications *(budgets, hearings, telephone directories, websites, etc)*
- Commercial data *(commercial imagery, financial assessments, databases, etc)*
- Grey literature *(technical reports, preprints, patents, business documents, etc)*


OSINT is a method of working with, assessing and ranking information ‚Äî We are living in the [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) and the volume of information OSINT research has to deal with [(information explosion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion) and the issue of low quality data leaves researchers drowning in poor quality info. The majority of this data is unstructured introducing many challenges to analyzing it and producing actionable intelligence since most data analytics databases are designed for structured data. 


We've decided to do something about it. The rapid developments in technologies such as AI and big data analytics have opened new horizons for OSINT which weren't previously available. We want our information quick and to the point, that's why we're building an open-source OSINT tool that's free. Free to use, free to modify, free to do with as you wish, and built with plain old web technologies anyone can learn. But this isn't really the project. This is a free new community. A community for OSINT enthusiasts around the world and we need your help to design it, to program it, and to build it. We want to hear your suggestions, your ideas, and we're going to build it right in front of your eyes. The notion of a ‚Äúneedle in a haystack‚Äù is taken to the extreme on the internet. Let's build a magnet.


### Key Alpha Features
- Simplified data fetching from custom sources using Python plugins.
- Visual representation of fetched data for easy understanding.
- A development platform that is open for contributions.
- Plugin-based system for transforming data, check out the [osintbuddy](https://pypi.org/project/osintbuddy/) package.


## Getting Started

To start using OSINTBuddy, follow these simple installation steps:

### Installation
1. Clone the repo and submodules
   ```sh
   git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jerlendds/osintbuddy.git
   # using ssh?
   # git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules git@github.com:jerlendds/osintbuddy.git 
   cd osintbuddy
   ```

2. Install Docker
    - [Install Guide for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
    - [Install Guide for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
    - [Install Guide for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

3. Start the stack with Docker:
   ```sh
   # ./launcher               # display usage information.
     ./launcher bootstrap     # first time? build images; setup ui and backend dependencies;
     ./launcher start         # start the osintbuddy stack.
   ```
   - **Note:** the stack will take a few minutes to startup while Solr and ScyllaDB configure themselves for JanusGraph. If you try to connect before all the databases are ready you will encounter errors.

- **URLs**
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - Casdoor: http://localhost:45910
  - Backend: http://localhost:48997/api
  - Documentation: http://localhost:48997/docs
- Access OSINTBuddy through the URLs provided for the frontend, backend, and documentation.

~~See the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/99Q70frX/) for a list of our upcoming features.~~

See the forum: [forum.osintbuddy.com](https://forum.osintbuddy.com), for a list of our upcoming features, to contribute feedback, ideas, and more (*Note: We're currently in the process of setting up the forum and moving trello issues over. We're not sure when this will be completed. For the time being you can count on dev log updates being on the forum from now on*).


See the [open issues](https://github.com/jerlendds/osintbuddy/issues)
for a list of requested features (and known issues).

### [‚Üë](#introducing-osintbuddy)Progress Notes

- [x] Website node
- [x] Google search node
- [x] Google cache search node
- [x] DNS node
- [x] URL node
- [x] IP node
- [x] CSE node
- [x] Username node
- [x] Added a plugin system
- [x] Updated plugin system to be easier to work with
- [x] Implemented automatic saving for project graphs
- [x] Added `ob` and `launcher` CLI tools
- [x] Added Casdoor for auth
- [x] Improved UI/UX

*Coming soon*
 - [] Add wizards for plugin create and custom `.env` setup
 - [] Rework plugin system to its own service
 - [] Add playwright and start reworking existing selenium based plugins  

For this update I recommend running bootstrap first, this sets up the new environment for containers: `./launcher bootstrap && ./launcher start`! After a 10m (up to 60m depending on internet speed) wait you'll be rewarded with a new UX, an updated plugin system now running as its own service, Casdoor managed auth for signing in/up, a new CLI tool, `ob`, for managing plugin development and the plugin server, and another CLI `./launcher` for managing the OSINTBuddy stack.
