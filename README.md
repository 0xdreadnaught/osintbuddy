  ## Introducing OSINTBuddy

  <p>
      Welcome to the OSINTBuddy project where you can connect, combine,
      and get insight from unstructured and public data as results that
      can be explored step-by-step. An easy-to-use plugin system allows any
      Python developer to quickly integrate new data sources.

### What is <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://osintbuddy.com">osintbuddy.com</a>?


Not much, yet.


But here's the concept:


An almost incomprehensible amount of data is created every day. And each year, figures are growing at an ever-increasing rate. These data sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:

- Public government data
- Media *(newspapers, magazines, radio)*
- Internet *(blogs, discussion groups, citizen media, etc)*
- Professional and academic publications *(budgets, hearings, telephone directories, websites, etc)*
- Commercial data *(commercial imagery, financial assessments, databases, etc)*
- Grey literature *(technical reports, preprints, patents, business documents, etc)*


OSINT is a method of working with, assessing and ranking information ‚Äî We are living in the [information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) and the volume of information OSINT research has to deal with [(information explosion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion) and the issue of low quality data leaves researchers drowning. The majority of this data is unstructured introducing many challenges to analyzing it and producing actionable intelligence since most data analytics databases are designed for structured data.


We've decided to do something about it. The rapid developments in technologies such as AI and big data analytics have opened new horizons for OSINT which weren't previously available. We want our information quick and to the point, that's why we're building an open-source OSINT tool that's free. Free to use, free to modify, free to do with as you wish, and built with plain old web technologies anyone can learn. But this isn't really the project. This is a free new community. A community for OSINT enthusiasts around the world and we need your help to design it, to program it, and to build it. We want to hear your suggestions, your ideas, and we're going to build it right in front of your eyes. The notion of a ‚Äúneedle in a haystack‚Äù is taken to the extreme on the internet. Let's build a magnet.


### Key Alpha Features
- Simplified data fetching from custom sources using Python plugins.
- Visual representation of fetched data for easy understanding.
- A development platform that is open for contributions.
- Plugin-based system for transforming data, check out the [osintbuddy](https://pypi.org/project/osintbuddy/) package.
- Works sometimes :)


### The future

At the core of this project lies a far more ambitious vision than the mere creation of a data aggregation tool. What we aspire to start is the birth of a knowledge-driven community, passionately dedicated to the development of an evolving intelligence tool - a system and platform designed for the discovery, interaction, and visualization of information to derive actionable insights. We imagine a system that not only learns from and evolves with human intellectual capabilities but also augments the same. We dream of a future where the vast expanse of information online, instead of being insurmountable, becomes a well-organized catalogue, where finding the "needle" is as straightforward as requesting it. Here are some of our ideas for the future in no particular order:


#### Collective intelligence through collaborative workspaces

- We want to create a platform that promotes collective intelligence. Consider currently popular collaborative workspaces such as Notion, Logseq, or Obsidian integrated seamlessly into our data workspace. A system where each individual user contributes to the pool of knowledge, where insights from your workspaces can be published and enagaged with by a global community. Where every connection made, every data source integrated, every plugin created and shared by members of our community contributes to advancing your insights and the community behind the OSINTBuddy project. 


#### Intuitive search and discovery tools

- To make the 'needle-hunt' in the haystack of the internet a breeze, we plan to include intuitive search and discovery tools. We want you to be able to interact with our algorithms, search for particular data, apply advanced query filters, data layouts, and more so you can uncover insights that matter via an easy-to-navigate web-based interface.

#### Real-time monitoring

- This functionality aims to provide real-time updates, alerting users to new relevant data, changes in trends, and emerging patterns in their field of interest, offering insights as they unfold.

#### AI, swarm intelligence, and evolutionary algorithms

- Inspired by nature, where simple creatures achieve complex tasks through collective decision making, our tool will mimic these principles where it can. Integrating AI, swarm intelligence, and evolutionary algorithms could let us create a tool that can continually evolve and optimize its operations over time. Imagine an intelligence system that fluidly adapts to the ever-changing landscapes of the internet.


## Getting Started

To start using OSINTBuddy, follow these simple installation steps:

### Installation
1. Clone the repo and submodules
   ```sh
   git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jerlendds/osintbuddy.git
   cd osintbuddy
   # using ssh?
   # git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules git@github.com:jerlendds/osintbuddy.git 
   ```

2. Install Docker & Compose
    - [Install Guide for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
    - [Install Guide for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
    - [Install Guide for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

3. Start the stack with Docker:
   ```sh
   # ./launcher               # display usage information.
   # ./launcher bootstrap     # first time working on osintbuddy? build images and 
   #                            setup development environments for the frontend and backend.
     ./launcher start         # start the osintbuddy stack.
   ```
   - **Note:** the stack will take a few minutes to startup while Solr and ScyllaDB configure themselves for JanusGraph. If you try to connect before all the databases are ready you will encounter errors.

- **URLs**
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - Casdoor: http://localhost:45910
  - Backend: http://localhost:48997/api
  - Documentation: http://localhost:48997/docs
- Access OSINTBuddy through the URLs provided for the frontend, backend, and documentation.
